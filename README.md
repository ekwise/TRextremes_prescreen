% Prescreen for extreme capture in tree-ring records

% Example data and code to accompany this manuscript:
% Wise, Erika K. and Matthew P. Dannenberg (2019). Climate Factors Leading  
% to Asymmetric Extreme Capture in the Tree-Ring Record, Geophysical  
% Research Letters. (to be updated post-publication)

% Using the example file, you can input existing tree-ring and climate data to 
% see if high and low climate extremes are captured by the tree-ring records.

% After running this code, you will have additional fields in the InputData
% structure that report the correlation with climate, the percentage of low 
% and high extreme years captured, and whether that represents significant 
% extreme capture at your p-level.  You will also have a new structure, 
% ExtremesCaptured, that contains only chronologies significantly capturing 
% both low and high extremes in the climate data.
