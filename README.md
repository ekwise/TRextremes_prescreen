% Prescreen for extreme capture in tree-ring records

% Example data and code to accompany this manuscript:

  to Asymmetric Extreme Capture in the Tree-Ring Record, Geophysical  
  Research Letters. (to be updated post-publication)

% Using the example file, you can input existing tree-ring and climate data to 
 see if high and low climate extremes are captured by the tree-ring records.

% After running this code, you will have additional fields in the InputData
 structure that report the correlation with climate, the percentage of low 
 and high extreme years captured, and whether that represents significant 
 extreme capture at your p-level.  You will also have a new structure, 
 ExtremesCaptured, that contains only chronologies significantly capturing 
 both low and high extremes in the climate data.
